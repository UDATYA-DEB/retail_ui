We provide a lifetime warranty and guarantee 100% money back.', '💡 How many drum rollers does a Whirlpool dryer have? The number of drum rollers in a Whirlpool dryer depends on the specific model of the dryer. However, most dryers typically have 2 drum support rollers, which are located at the rear of the dryer drum. These rollers help support the weight of the drum and allow it to rotate smoothly during operation. Some newer models of Whirlpool dryers may have 4 drum rollers instead of 2, which can provide additional support and stability to the dryer drum.', ""💡 Why do dryer rollers wear out? Dryer rollers can wear out due to factors such as frequent use of the dryer, lack of lubrication, overloading, debris and dirt buildup, and poor maintenance. Over time, the dryer drum's rotation on the rollers can create friction and wear them down. Regular lubrication is necessary to prevent excessive friction and premature wear and tear. To make your dryer rollers last longer, it's important to do routine maintenance and fix any problems in time.""]",[],7.95,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51cQ42cOypL._AC_.jpg,"{'title': ['341241 Belt & 349241T Drum Roller', 'Save Tons of Money on the Repair - Fast & Reliable Service', 'Money-Back Guarantee for Most Parts - No Questions Asked', '#1 Place for DIY Repair - Affordable Solution for Your Home', 'Dryer drum belt', '4392065 Dryer Repair Kit by Seentech', 'Why choose Funmit?', '341241 Dryer Belt & 8066184 Motor Pulley by Seentech', '4392065 repair kit for whirlpool dryer', 'install 4392065 Roper Dryer Repair Kit'], 'url': ['https://www.amazon.com/vdp/0171dc9d1f5c4fe88b5e2c58d684714e?ref=dp_vse_rvc_0', 'https://www.amazon.com/vdp/0a5f91a7571a4f41a287fe90f20e9477?ref=dp_vse_rvc_1', 'https://www.amazon.com/vdp/03d9ea1314484fc7a150c8b994010230?ref=dp_vse_rvc_2', 'https://www.amazon.com/vdp/0c5e7b7668714583a482361be25e3d74?ref=dp_vse_rvc_3', 'https://www.amazon.com/vdp/079db5b9f8bd419288be761173385f99?ref=dp_vse_rvc_4', 'https://www.amazon.com/vdp/0df3becea81e419ab06c52d32e9b0972?ref=dp_vse_rvc_5', 'https://www.amazon.com/vdp/0397fec70ccf42dda37ec590b4594d45?ref=dp_vse_rvc_6', 'https://www.amazon.com/vdp/0cc80c9b2aa5430cbdfa6f127b7bbc50?ref=dp_vse_rvc_7', 'https://www.amazon.com/vdp/0da1140a201b448c853ba915576e017d?ref=dp_vse_rvc_8', 'https://www.amazon.com/vdp/c57fd0c4226a49d68176938ee6651909?ref=dp_vse_rvc_9'], 'user_id': ['', '', '', '', '/shop/reloadingweatherby', '', '', '', '', '']}",PartsBroz,"['Appliances', 'Parts & Accessories', 'Dryer Parts & Accessories', 'Replacement Parts']","{""Manufacturer"": ""PartsBroz"", ""Part Number"": ""341241 & 349241T"", ""Item Weight"": ""4.2 ounces"", ""Package Dimensions"": ""5.71 x 3.03 x 1.1 inches"", ""Item model number"": ""341241 & 349241T"", ""Size"": ""Medium"", ""Color"": ""As pictured"", ""Style"": ""349241T Drum Roller"", ""Included Components"": ""Dryer Drum Roller Kit"", ""Batteries Included?"": ""No"", ""Batteries Required?"": ""No"", ""Warranty Description"": ""Lifetime Warranty"", ""Best Sellers Rank"": {""Tools & Home Improvement"": 18458, ""Dryer Replacement Parts"": 159}, ""Date First Available"": ""January 7, 2020"", ""Brand"": ""PartsBroz"", ""Compatible Devices"": ""Washing Machine""}",B0BLZQYHPT,,,,100
